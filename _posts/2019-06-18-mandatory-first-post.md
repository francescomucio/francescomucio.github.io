I'm about to start a new adventure and I heard that a personal website can be a good thing. On the other hand
 I always wanted to take some time to write down the few things I am doing or I did in the last few years, I heard that is good too.

 What this page will be about? Mostly things I do at work, which means data and code, I don't think people will be interesting in my rants, 
 not until I make them into a full standup routine. 

What I am trying to learn at moment:
- How to use [Jekill](https://jekyllrb.com/).
